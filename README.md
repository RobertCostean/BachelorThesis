# BachelorThesis
Description: Developed an AI-driven system to analyze financial risks in stock market investments, leveraging advanced machine learning models alongside traditional financial metrics.

Predictive Modeling with LSTM: Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices based on 60-day historical data, effectively capturing trends and dependencies in financial time series data.

Sentiment Analysis for Market Insights: Applied a fine-tuned BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles, integrating sentiment scores into the risk assessment framework to provide a more informed analysis.

Integrated Risk Score Calculation: Combined predictions from LSTM models, sentiment analysis, and traditional technical indicators into a comprehensive risk score, offering a detailed assessment of stock market risks.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and natural language processing, particularly in the context of risk analysis, with potential applications in various data-driven decision-making processes
